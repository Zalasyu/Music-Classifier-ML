## mypy: mypy is a static type checker for Python that aims to combine the benefits of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing. Path: Makefile
## pre-commit: pre-commit is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. Path: Makefile
## 		Check pre-commit yaml file for more details
## 		https://pre-commit.com/
## 		It invokes the following hooks:
## 		- Requirements.txt checker
## 		- Line endings normalizer
## 		- Tab character checker
## 		- Black code formatter
## 		- isort code formatter
## black: Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. Path: Makefile
## flake8: Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools: PyFlakes, pycodestyle, Ned Batchelderâ€™s McCabe script. Path: Makefile
## pylint: Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions. Path: Makefile
## isort: isort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections and by type. Path: Makefile
check: ## Lint code using pre-commit and run mypy and deptry.
