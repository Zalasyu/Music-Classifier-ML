## Business Understanding

### Objectives

1. Build a dataset containg song metadata and their various genres and spectrograph info.
2. Develop a pipeline to import audio clips from datasets
3. Create a web app front-end (can run on desktop).
4. Host the program as a web server.
5. Develop a program to run a user-submitted audio clip against the model and print results witha ccuracy metrics
6. Content based recommender system for music similar to audio clip
   - Train a neural network

### Situation

The user will enter a song clip, then receive a formatted top-n list of genres sorted by confidence value in descending order.
